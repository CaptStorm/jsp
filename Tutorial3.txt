Lets build a form

form.html or .jsp
<form action = "student-response.jsp">

First Name:
<input type = "text" name = "firstName" />

Last Name:
<input type = "text" name = "lastName" />

<input type = "Submit" value = "submit" />
</form>

student-response.jsp

You entered ${param.firstName} ${param.lastName} 



let's add more stuff to the form

Let's add drop down list
Add this to html page

I am from 
<select = "state">
<option>California</option>
<option>Nevada</option>
<option>Idaho</option>
<option>Wisconsin</option>
</select>

now, add this to student-response.jsp
You are from ${param.state}

Let's say you want to add radio button option
You need to add this to html page

<input type = "radio" name = "favLang" value = "Java"> Java
<input type = "radio" name = "favLang" value = "Javascript"> Javascript
<input type = "radio" name = "favLang" value = "PHP"> PHP
<input type = "radio" name = "favLang" value = "C++"> C++
<input type = "radio" name = "favLang" value = "Python"> Python

Let's go back to student-response.jsp and add this
Your favorite programming language is ${param.favLang}

Now, checkbox html and jsp is interesting and different because you can choose multiple options with checkbox vs radio button

<input type = "checkBox" name = "clubsInvolved" value = "Chess"> Chess
<input type = "checkBox" name = "clubsInvolved" value = "Hiking"> Hiking
<input type = "checkBox" name = "clubsInvolved" value = "Language and Culture"> Language and Culture
<input type = "checkBox" name = "clubsInvolved" value = "Tutoring"> Tutoring

Now let's add this to student - request.jsp
<ul>
<% 
  String[] clubs=request.getParameterValue("clubsInvolved");
  for (String tempClubs:clubsInvolved){
  out.printIn("<li>" + clubs + "</li>");
  }
  %>
  </ul>
